# Private Chat Website

This is a simple private chat website that allows entry only with a special code. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Features
- Login screen with access code
- Simple chat interface

## Deployment
1. Clone this repository.
2. Push the code to a GitHub repository.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
4. Share the link with your friends (along with the special code) to use the chat.

## Note
GitHub Pages only supports static files, so this chat is front-end only and doesn't save messages permanently.
